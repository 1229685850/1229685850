# StarCraft
This is an implementation of the multi-agent algrithms, [QMIX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485) and [VDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05296), both of which are the state of art multi-agent algrithms.We trained these algrithms on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), which is the decentralised micromanagement scenarios of [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty)
## Result
Although qmix and vdn are the state of art multi-agent algrithms, they are unstable sometimes, you need to independently run several times to get better performence.
